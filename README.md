About This Project:

This is the first project I completed for the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. I built a tool that takes a list of 9 numbers and turns them into a 3x3 matrix to calculate things like Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation. It was a great introduction to how Data Analysts actually process numbers in the real world using Python.

What I learned while building this:
1. NumPy Basics: I learned how to use numpy to handle matrices. The biggest takeaway was understanding how to use axis=0 and axis=1 to calculate results for columns vs. rows.
2. Environment Setup: This project taught me a lot about working in VS Code, managing different Python versions, and using the terminal.
3. Troubleshooting: I spent time learning how to read error messages and how to use the "Problems" tab to fix my code before running it.
4. Version Control: I used Git and GitHub to save my progress and document my work—which was a huge learning curve but feels great to have working now!

How to run it:
Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed.
Clone this repo.
Run "python3 main.py" in your terminal.
